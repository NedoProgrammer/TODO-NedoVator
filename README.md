# NedoVator

Or Nedo Motivator, is a little TODO app with a little character Nedo watching what you do!

### Does it work?

[Mhm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgwvDE0iTGo)

### Installing/Building

Right now, the Windows release is recommended, but I will add the instructions on how to build it a *bit* later.

### Running

You will need .NET 5 to run this app. You can install it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
